### Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system
used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is
proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic
wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with
